Key Takeaways:
Small models prioritize efficiency and cost-effectiveness, often deployed in resource-constrained environments.
Medium models offer a balance between performance and resource usage, making them suitable for general enterprise needs.
Large models push the boundaries of performance, handling complex and nuanced tasks but come with significant resource and cost demands.
